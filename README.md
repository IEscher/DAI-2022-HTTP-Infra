# Labo HTTP Infra

## Step 1: Static HTTP server with apache httpd

### Webcasts

* [Labo HTTP (1): Serveur apache httpd "dockeris√©" servant du contenu statique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFO4OmcfI3U)

### Note

* You will probably have trouble to use PHP 8 with Apache, we recommend using PHP 7 instead.

### Acceptance criteria

* You have a GitHub repo with everything needed to build the Docker image.
* You can do a demo, where you build the image, run a container and access content from a browser.
* You have used a nice looking web template, different from the one shown in the webcast.
* You are able to explain what you do in the Dockerfile.
* You are able to show where the apache config files are located (in a running container).
* You have **documented** your configuration in your report.
