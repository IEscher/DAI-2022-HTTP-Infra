## Step 6: Management UI

The goal of this step is to deploy or develop a Web app that can be used to monitor and update your Web infrastructure dynamically. You should be able to list running containers, start/stop them and add/remove instances.

There are two options for this step:

* you use an existing solution (search on Google)
* you develop your own Web app (e.g. with express.js). In this case, you can use the Dockerode npm module (or another Docker client library, in any of the supported languages) to access the docker API.

### Acceptance criteria

* You can do a demo to show the Management UI and manage the containers of your infrastructure.
* You have **documented** your configuration in your report.
