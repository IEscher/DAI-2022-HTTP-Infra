## Objectives

The first objective of this lab is to get familiar with software tools that will allow us to build a **complete web infrastructure**. By that, we mean that we will build an environment that will allow us to serve **static and dynamic content** to web browsers. To do that, we will see how to configure a **Web server** and a **reverse proxy**. We will also see that **express.js** is a JavaScript framework that makes it very easy to write dynamic web apps.

The second objective is to implement a simple, yet complete, **dynamic web application**. We will create **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** assets that will be served to the browsers and presented to the users. The JavaScript code executed in the browser will issue asynchronous HTTP requests to our web infrastructure (**AJAX requests**) and fetch content generated dynamically.

The third objective is to practice our usage of **Docker**. All the components of the web infrastructure will be packaged in custom Docker images (we will create at least 3 different images). We will also use **Docker compose** to define a complete infrastructure with several components.

For further explanations, please refer to [Lab5' statements file](Lab5-Statements.md).

### Note

A dedicated branch has been made for each step of the laboratory. Doing so, it allows us to easily test each step separately. 

Except for step1, we both tried to do a version, so one version is in the dedicated branch, the other (and the one finally used) is in the step2's branch.

## Step 1: Static HTTP server with apache httpd

### Acceptance criteria

All steps to dockerfile's rules, create container, launch and access it are described in the [step1's README file](docker-images/step1/README.md)

The website used this [free bootstrap's template](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/creative).

* You are able to show where the apache config files are located (in a running container).
* You have **documented** your configuration in your report.

### In brief

Change directory to [docker-images/step1](docker-images/step1)

In the shell, create container:

```shell
docker build --tag <A_USEFUL_AND_EASILY_IDENTIFIABLE_IMAGE_NAME> .
# Here's a tag if you don't have one easily :D
docker build --tag dai/http_step1 .
```

Run it:

```shell
docker run -p 9090:80 --rm <TAGGED_IMAGE_NAME>
# With tagged container
docker run -p 9090:80 --rm dai/http_step1
```

With a browser, access it by typing in the nav. bar:

```shell
http://localhost:9090
```

## Step 2: Dynamic HTTP server with express.js

All steps to dockerfile's rules, create container, launch and access it are described in the [step2's README file](docker-images/step2/README.md)

As asked to do differently (see Step2 section in [statements](Lab5-Statements.md), our generator gives random server's configuration (formatted as JSON, like those used in [our previous lab](https://github.com/KC5-BP/DAI-2022-SMTP-Classe-B/blob/main/config/configServer.json)) as dynamic payloads.

### In brief

Change directory to [docker-images/step2](docker-images/step2)

In the shell, create container:

```shell
docker build --tag <A_USEFUL_AND_EASILY_IDENTIFIABLE_IMAGE_NAME> .
# Here's a friendly tag again ^^
docker build --tag dai/http_step2 .
```

Run it:

```shell
docker run -p 8080:3000 --rm <TAGGED_IMAGE_NAME>
# With tagged container
docker run -p 8080:3000 --rm dai/http_step2
```

With a browser, access it by typing in the nav. bar:

```shell
http://localhost:8080
```

This must output some server's config. in JSON format, and different ones at each page reload.

## Step 3: Docker compose to build the infrastructure

Here, we will deploy a 1st version of the infrastructure with a static and dynamic web servers (respectively step1 & step2) using Docker compose.

* You will need to install Docker compose on your machine. You'll find the instructions [on this link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
* You will need to write a `docker-compose.yml` file. To do this, read the [introduction](https://docs.docker.com/compose/features-uses/), then have a look at this [tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/). They should provide the information you need to write your docker-compose file.

### In brief

The first time, it is good to build all services:

```shell
docker-compose build
```

Then, start them:

```shell
# To build (optional) and run, but this will monopolize the shell
docker-compose up [--build]

# To run in background
docker-compose start
```

We can visit the services through a browser by typing in the nav. bar:

```shell
# Accessing static
http://localhost:9000

# Accessing dynamic
http://localhost:9001 # '/' being the default will tell that you'll have better chance with '/api' (kept because of the following part)
http://localhost:9001/api # JSON configs
```

*Note: Might need to clear "Form & search history" to avoid auto-completion of a suggested page*

## Step 3 (follow up): Reverse proxy with Traefik

The goal of this step is to run a reverse proxy in front of the dynamic and static Web servers such that the reverse proxy receives all connections and relays them to the respective Web server. 

### Acceptance criteria

* You have a GitHub repo with everything needed to build the various images.
* You can do a demo where you start from an "empty" Docker environment (no container running) and using docker compose you can start your infrastructure with 3 containers: static server, dynamic server and reverse proxy
* In the demo you can access each Web server from the browser in the demo. You can prove that the routing is done correctly through the reverse proxy.
* You are able to explain how you have implemented the solution and walk us through the configuration and the code.
* You are able to explain why a reverse proxy is useful to improve the security of the infrastructure.
* You have **documented** your configuration in your report.


## Step 3a: Dynamic cluster management

The goal of this section is to allow Traefik to dynamically detect several instances of the (dynamic/static) Web servers. You may have already done this in the previous step 3.

Modify your `docker-compose.yml` file such that several instances of each Web server are started. Check that the reverse proxy distributes the connections between the different instances.

### Acceptance criteria

* The modified `docker-compose.yml` file is in your GitHub repo.
* You can use docker compose to start the infrastructure with several instances of each Web server.
* You can do a demo to show that Traefik performs load balancing among the instances.
* If you add or remove instances, you can show that the load balancer is dynamically updated to use the available instances.
* You have **documented** your configuration in your report.

## Step 4: AJAX requests with JQuery

The goal of the step is to use AJAX requests to dynamically update a Web page every few seconds with data coming from the dynamic Web server.

Note: in the webcast we introduce you to JQuery, but you can also use the more modern [JavaScript Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to easily make AJAX requests.

### Webcasts

* [Labo HTTP (4): AJAX avec JQuery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgpNEbgdm5k)

### Acceptance criteria

* You have a GitHub repo with everything needed to build the various images.
* You can do a complete, end-to-end demonstration: the web page is dynamically updated every few seconds (with the data coming from the dynamic backend).
* You are able to prove that AJAX requests are sent by the browser and you can show the content of the responses.
* You have **documented** your configuration in your report.

## Step 5: Load balancing: round-robin and sticky sessions

By default, Traefik uses Round Robin to distribute the load among all available instances. However, if a service is stateful, it would be better to send requests of the same session always to the same instance. This is called sticky sessions.

The goal of this step is to change the configuration such that:

* Traefik uses sticky session for the static Web server instances
* Traefik continues to use round robin for the dynamic servers (no change required)

### Acceptance criteria

* You do a setup to demonstrate the notion of sticky session.
* You prove that your load balancer can distribute HTTP requests in a round-robin fashion to the dynamic server nodes (because there is no state).
* You prove that your load balancer can handle sticky sessions when forwarding HTTP requests to the static server nodes.
* You have **documented** your configuration and your validation procedure in your report.

## Step 6: Management UI

The goal of this step is to deploy or develop a Web app that can be used to monitor and update your Web infrastructure dynamically. You should be able to list running containers, start/stop them and add/remove instances.

There are two options for this step:

* you use an existing solution (search on Google)
* you develop your own Web app (e.g. with express.js). In this case, you can use the Dockerode npm module (or another Docker client library, in any of the supported languages) to access the docker API.

### Acceptance criteria

* You can do a demo to show the Management UI and manage the containers of your infrastructure.
* You have **documented** your configuration in your report.
